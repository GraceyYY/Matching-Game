# Matching-Game
This is a project of Udacity using Javascript and Jquery. The initial frame is provided by Udacity and the final version is  revised and completed by myself.
+ **Animation**: All the fantastic animations in the matching game are from [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)!
+ **Icon**: All the cooll icons in the matching game are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)!
# How to play
1. Open the card by clicking it. 
2. Click another card which you assume may have the same icon with the previous one.
3. If the icon on those two cards are the same, those cards will stay on the screen.
3. If those two cards don't match, they will automatically turn to the back and you need to start again.
4. When all cards are matched, you win!
5. Tips: try to remember the card and icon as much as you can!
